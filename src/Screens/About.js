              <p>
                  Iâ€™m a growing web developer with a mathematical brain
                  and an artistic point of view. My interest in
                  programming stemmed from my fascination with
                  the way things work and wanting to take a look behind
                  the curtain. Once I learned how to build programs in
                  highschool it gave me a new perspective and I knew that
                  this is what I wanted to do for a living. I come from a
                  family of builders and I aspire to use that foundation
                  to build new solutions that solve large scale problems in
                  the world of tech.
